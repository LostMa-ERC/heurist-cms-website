<h2>Recommended Workflow</h2>

<p>A literary work's tradition can be recorded through 6 entities. There are more entities available in the data model, which can (and sometimes should) be used to enrich the tradition's components.</p>
    
<p>When entering the tradition into the database, we recommend you start from the abstract literary content, the cycle or work, and proceed toward the concrete, the document and its parts.</p>

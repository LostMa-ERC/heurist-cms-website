                <p>Several record types contain temporal information, especially about when an object began to exist. For example, the <span class="badge-entity">Text</span> record type requires a <span class="badge-field">date_of_creation</span>. Dates in Heurist can be precise or imprecise.</p>

                <p>The type of metadata you can attach to an imprecise date depends on how you are entering data.</p>

                <b>CSV import</b>

                <p>When entering data via CSV import, you can only provide a precise date or a simple date range. The granularity of the precise date or the beginning and ending of the date range can vary. You can give a year (YYYY), a month (YYYY-MM), or a day (YYYY-MM-DD).</p>
                
                <p>To provide a range, separate the two dates by a period. In the example shown below, we see a column containing a precise date, the year 1180, and a range, between 1230 and 1235.</p>

                <table class="table table-bordered">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>date_of_creation</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>1180</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>1230.1235</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <p>These are the only types of information that can be provided via CSV import.</p>

                <b>Manual import</b>

                <p>Heurist's user interface, however, allows for more precision about the imprecision of a date or a date range. By clicking the range icon next to the data field, you open a pop-up window that has four types of date formats: Simple Date, Simple Range, Fuzzy Range, and Radiometric. In our workflow, you are free to use any of the first three, each of which is described in detail below.</p>

                <h3>Simple Date</h3>
                <p>The Simple Date tab allows you to attach metadata to a year, month, or day.</p>
                <p>After entering the precise date, select one of the radio buttons to the right: "Exact," "Circa/approximate," "Before," or "After." Heurist will automatically select, as a default, the button "Exact."</p>
                <p>In our workflow, we do not expect you to describe the type of certainty about the simple date, as indicated by the four levels of "Type of Determination": unknown, attested, conjecture, and measurement. You can enter this information if you want, but it will not be present on my records and no scaled treatment of this information is planned.</p>
                <p>Do not adjust the type of calendar used on the Simple Date. Leave the default Gregorian selection.</p>

                <h3>Fuzzy Range</h3>
                <p>The Fuzzy Range tab allows you to detail two overlapping spans of time, the possible and the probable. The fuzzy range is based on four dates:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Terminus post quem</b>: The earliest point in time when it would be possible for the event to have taken place.</li>
                    <li><b>Probable begin</b>: The earliest point in time when it is likely the event took place. To set it to the same as the terminus post quem, click the "set" button.</li>
                    <li><b>Probable end</b>: The latest point in time when it is likely that the event took place. To set it to the same as the terminus ante quem, click the "set" button.</li>
                    <li><b>Terminus ante quem</b>: The latest point in time when it would be possible for the event to have taken place.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>From the drop-down menus "Start Profile" and "End Profile," you can detail the distribution of probability between the possible extreme time points and the likely internal time points. The options are the following: flat, central, slow start, slow finish. When you do not know the distribution, leave the default value: flat.</p>

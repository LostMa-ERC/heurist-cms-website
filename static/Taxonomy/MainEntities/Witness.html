    </h5>
    <div class="card-text">
      <p>
        According to a fourteenth-century inventory of a library at the Abbey of Peterborough, there was a Witness to the French Text <em>chanson d'Otinel</em> in the monks' collection; however, the inventoried manuscript no longer exists.
      </p>
      <p>
        When creating the <span class="badge-entity">Witness</span> entity, set "is hypothetical" to "True" and create a <span class="badge-entity">Hypothesis</span> entity, shown below, that links to the lost <em>chanson d'Otinel</em> and details the claim attesting to its existence.
        The hypothetical <span class="badge-entity">Witness</span> can be related to more than one <span class="badge-entity">Hypothesis</span>, which has its own degree of certainty and draws on its own sources of information to make the argument.

    <div class="card-text">
      <p>
        Fragments from the Anglo-Norman texts of the <em>chanson d'Otinel</em> (M) and <em>chanson d'Aspremont</em> (P4) are currently conserved in a collection of fragments at the Bibliothèque nationale de France, under the shelfmark NAF 5094. There is another fragmentary witness (C) of the same Anglo-Norman <em>chanson d'Aspremont</em> text in a different document, I F2, in the Clermont Ferrand archives départementales.
        Scholars have argued that the two fragments of <em>chanson d'Aspremont</em> (P4, C) were originally created as one, representing different parts of the same text. Furthermore, the fragment of <em>chanson d'Otinel</em> (M), which was discovered and conserved with that of <em>chanson d'Aspremont</em> in BNF NAF 5094, was also originally part of the same manuscript that had the complete <em>chanson d'Aspremont</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To recognize that these witnesses (M, P4, C) were originally transmitted in the same document, create a <span class="badge-entity">Document</span> entity and set the attribute "is hypothetical" to "True." Then, link the <span class="badge-entity">Witness</span> entities to the hypothetical <span class="badge-entity">Document</span>. They will then each be linked to two <span class="badge-entity">Document</span> entities, one real, by which they can be consulted, and the other attested, which supports an historical hypothesis.
        Lastly, to document the argument or arguments attesting to the hypothetical manuscript's existence, create a <span class="badge-entity">Hypothesis</span> entity and link it to the <span class="badge-entity">Document</span> that has "is hypothetical" set to "False."
